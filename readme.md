# Introduction
Design specification:
As a team, design and implement a solution for automating the development workflows and deployments of an unfamiliar application in a restricted timeframe.<br/>
<br/>
The application we were given was a vet clinic web app with separate front and backend infrastructure. This application was written in a mix of Java and TypeScript, two languages that my team and I have little to no experience with. <br/>
<br/>
Our goal was to create a pipeline for continuous development and automated deployment. Utilising the tools, systems and principals we have learned up until now and do it all within a self managed team. <br/>
All of these steps are to recreate a realistic scenario we might face on deployment. <br/>
<br/>
Through this presentation we hope to demonstrate;
- A working knowledge of tools including terraform and kubernetes
- The ability to work effectively on the Azure cloud platform
- The use of Agile and DevOps principles
- The ability to work as a self-managed autonomous team
- An understanding of the importance and use of conventions<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

# In the Beginning
As we were given full autonomy on how we approached this task we first took to a teams call to begin planning our approach. <br/>
We selected Azure DevOps as our project planning tool of choice as it has good integration with other Azure products. We also felt that using Azures project management offering would help provide us with more experience working within the Azure cloud environment. <br/>
<br/>
With a start made and sticking to the Agile ways of working we "elected" a scrum master to lead and manage the organisation of the project tracking side of things. <br/>
Our Kanban board near the end looked like this;<br/>

<br/>
Using our board we created 4 columns to categorize our work.<br/>
- Backlog - For things that we decided were not going to be achieved this sprint.
- ToDo - For things needing done, ordered by priority top-bottom.
- Doing -  For things currently being worked on, to avoid multiple people accidently working on the same thing. 
- Done - For completed items, promoting high morale as we can see how far we have come. <br/>

<br/>
This board was our map through the sprint and enabled us to work quickly and efficiently throughout.<br/>
<br/>
It was at this point we established some conventions
